Ingredients:
 - 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
 - 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
 - 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
 - 2 teaspoons coarse salt
 - 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
 - 1 1/2 cups packed light-brown sugar
 - 1 cup granulated sugar
 - 2 large eggs
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
 - 1 1/4 cups milk chocolate chips
 - 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

Directions:
 1. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
 2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugars on medium-high until light 
    and fluffy, 6 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low and beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in vanilla. Mix in flour mixture just until incorporated; fold in chocolate chips and chunks.
 3. Using a 1/4-cup ice-cream scoop or a large spoon, drop dough onto a parchment-lined baking 
    sheet (you should have 24) and refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, with racks in upper and lower thirds. Arrange 6 unbaked cookies, 3 inches apart, on each of two parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until edges are light golden brown, 17 to 18 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool. Bake remaining dough using new parchment.
